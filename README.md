# 😷 Face Mask Detector

This is my Final Project for the **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** course (6th Semester).  
It is a real-time **Face Mask Detection System** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and a **CNN model**.

The application captures live video from a webcam and detects whether the person is wearing a mask or not. It displays a **bounding box** around the face with a label:

- 🟩 **With Mask** (Green Box)
- 🟥 **Without Mask** (Red Box)

---

## 📸 Features

- Real-time face mask detection via webcam
- Displays bounding box + label on detected faces
- Works with live video stream
- Based on a trained CNN model

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pre-trained CNN model (`mask_detection_model.h5`)
- Haar Cascade for face detection
- VS Code

---

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses a dataset from **Kaggle**:  
[Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)

> ⚠️ Due to size restrictions, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.

To retrain the model, download the dataset and place it inside a folder named `dataset/`.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Motasim-Naranja/-Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN-OpenCV.git
cd Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN-OpenCV
````

2. Activate your virtual environment:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the detection script:

```bash
python mask_detection_realtime.py
```

> Make sure your webcam is connected.
